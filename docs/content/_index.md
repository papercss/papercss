#### CDN

Don't want to download it? That's cool. You can just link to PaperCSS via
[unpkg's CDN](https://unpkg.com/#/). You can use either:

- [https://unpkg.com/papercss@1.9.1/dist/paper.css](https://unpkg.com/papercss@1.9.1/dist/paper.css)
- [https://unpkg.com/papercss@1.9.1/dist/paper.min.css](https://unpkg.com/papercss@1.9.1/dist/paper.min.css)

Here's a quick snippet to get started with PaperCSS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://unpkg.com/papercss@1.9.1/dist/paper.min.css"
    />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="paper container">
      <h1>Some Fresh Title</h1>
      <p>This is where some content would go.</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Build it Yourself

If you'd rather customize things, you can build the CSS yourself via the git repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/papercss/papercss.git
cd papercss
npm install
npm run build
```

Grab the CSS out of the /dist folder created

You can also go into src/core/\_config.scss before building to change around the global styles of your new CSS.
